# Introduction 
This is the repository of the official Andoid and iOS 18App mobile applications, developed with Xamarin.Forms framework

# Getting Started
The code is contained as a single Visual Studio solution in the `/scr` folder.
As always, the first thing to do is to fork the project and then open it in your Visual Studio.

Please refer to [Xamarin Forms documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/get-started/installation?tabs=windows#windows-system-requirements) to install all the need development tools.

# Contribute
Contribution is welcomed, but we're actually busy on the production of the first beta release, so the codebase is changing fast and a lot.
After beta release we can start to evaluate your PRs (Pull Resquests).
As always, please first create an issue, so we can debate on how to solve it and then do your contribution and create the PR, so we can review it more esaily. Do not work on multiple issues (unless they are tied together) on the same PR.

# Introduction 
This is the repository of the official Andoid and iOS 18App mobile applications, developed with the Xamarin.Forms framework.

# Getting Started
The code is contained as a single Visual Studio solution in the `/scr` folder.
Fork the project and then open it in your Visual Studio.

Please refer to [Xamarin Forms documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/get-started/installation?tabs=windows#windows-system-requirements) to install all the need development tools.

You can then build and test locally with your emulated/simulated or fisical devices.

The production of release artifacts at the moment are built and uploaded to the Google Play store and the Apple Store by me.
We will eventually set a CI/CD build configuration with the freely available Azure DevOps service, after the GA release version 1.0.

# Contribute
Contribution is welcomed, but we're busy on the first beta release, so the codebase is changing fast and a lot.
After beta release we can start to evaluate your PRs (Pull Requests).
Please first create an issue, so we can debate on how to solve it and then do your contribution and create the PR, so we can review it more easily. Do not put your work on multiple issues (unless they are strongly tied together) on the same PR, as each PR should solve a specific issue.
